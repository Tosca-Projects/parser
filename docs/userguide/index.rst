Parser is an open source project and licensed under Apache 2. Parser will help
to provide a tooling mechanism, by parsing and then further translating Telecom
operators deployment descriptors into certain common templates, which could be
used in IaaS orchestration projects like OpenStack Heat(the template file is HOT,
which stands for Heat Orchestrator Template).

This document contains installation guide , execution guide as well as testing guide
for Parser's three submodules: tosca2heat, yang2tosca and policy2tosca.
